## Complains about _habits_

This is for the married women who complain about their husbands’ habits!!

When you came in his life, you did not bother where he keeps his socks or how many times he uses a coffee mug before considering to wash!

Slowly you expressed your love by helping him get organized, cook food that he likes and do the little gestures to keep him happy. The husband feels good and enjoys the attention as well as some help. Time changes and he wants to do something that he really likes!! Video games or sports or a novel!!

You feel that he is not taking care of his basic needs. You suddenly feel that you are doing his laundry and you are keeping his bank accounts!  You feel that he is dirty or clumsy. You feel that his mother did not teach him how to live a responsible life. You start feeling that he doesn’t care. Right? Does this sound like your story?

Then my dear lady, think back. Remember your man was living with satisfaction even before he met you. Remember that you had liked him as he was. If you came and change the way he arranges his socks or underwear, you changed his eating habits, you change the place he keeps his shoes just because you have a lot more than him.

If you really want to get free from his conflicts, let your man decide where he wants to keep his stuff. Let him make those daily decisions where he spends and how much he eats. Do not become his decision maker that he stops acting by himself!! If he has a place or chore in his mind, he will do it – where and when it feels right. You may have a timeline or provide a gentle reminder. Maybe use ‘I statement’ and let him know how you feel with unwashed laundry for days.

Your mom did not do this. She did all the household work as that was how the roles were traditionally divided. Today, for us, if both of us are working then leave the habit of micromanaging your husbands and children like your mom. They would do it without you and you get accustomed to that. Do not wish to receive compliments for all you do for them after all people do what they want to do not what others want them to do. Go free yourself!
