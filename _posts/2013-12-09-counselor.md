Teachers are the building blocks in the school. They touched students life directly and in many ways. Especially, elementary school teachers are ready to see the kids and teach them the best they could. Each year they prepare their room and wait for the kids to enter enthusiastically. They also hope for cooperative and realistic parents. As a support staff, school counselor, could start with knowing these teachers. They have a lot of treasure accumulated over the years, about children, through direct or indirect experiences. Some are clear in their goals for students while others might not. In the initial week, it is best to get to know the building, teachers, other staff. As the kids walk in, observation as a skill, comes handy. Observing kids not only in classroom; but cafeteria, gym, playground, parking and sometimes in bathroom; feeds a lot to the counselor.
