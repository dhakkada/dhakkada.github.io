Teachers are the building blocks of a school.

They touch students life directly and in many indirect ways. Elementary school teachers, especially are ready to see the kids and teach them the best they could. Each year they enthusiastically prepare their room and wait for the kids to enter. They also hope for cooperative and realistic parents.

As a support staff, a school counselor should start with knowing these teachers. They are a treasure trove of accumulated wisdom about children through direct and indirect experiences. Some are clear in their goals for students while others may not be.

As a counselor, in the initial week, it is best to get to know the building, teachers, and other staff. As the kids walk in, _observation_ as a skill comes handy. Observing kids not only in classroom; but cafeteria, gym, playground, parking, and even in private spaces provides a lot of food for thought to the counselor.
