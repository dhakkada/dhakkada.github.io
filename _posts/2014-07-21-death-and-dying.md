Today I received one more death news. One more dear person died yesterday in India and I got the news over the phone. The news was delivered and then it was followed by other news and talk. In these last three years, that I am being away, the news of death of each known one, brings me much closer to the reality of life. 
One by one it makes me more conscious of this myth that we call life. It brings me more close to miss them. It reminds me that I am still not good. I need to change myself and be loving and kind always, which I am not! It reminds me of the fruitless running behind something assuming that is it! 
One of the first imprint about life and death was a visit to some Jain temple. I do not remember where, but I do remember looking at a carving that depicts people entering the world and other people exiting the world. The people who were entering, their heads were up. Symbolically showing that they are optimistic about life and are looking forward to it. The people who were leaving, their heads were down. Symbolically showing that they did not do anything that made them feel eternally good about themselves. May be they simply wasted time! Sitting here in this world I do not want to get into how and what of time wasting! 

That impression has always remained in my mind. It reminds me of what I want to do before I leave this world. Normally I am allured by the world around me, the world that we humans have created. It reminds me to become rich, to become powerful, to become a leader, to enjoy life with friends and family, to do something for others round the clock. However, some days like this, reminds me that there is more to life. And that life ends with a death. The time is not never ending. The time comes for everyone. 

I do not know, how my life would be until I die? Would I see old age or not! Would I be happy then or not! I do know is that I am postponing many desires today to enjoy my life tomorrow. What tomorrow, when tomorrow, I do not know. May be my head is still in the up position. Coming near 30 I still feel I have lot to live and to do. However, if the time comes and what if I am not able to do that. 

Today, I want to remind myself one thing and that is to become better in loving and being kind. I am not better than thou. I am better when I am loving.
