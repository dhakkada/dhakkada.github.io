I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. 

I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. 

I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. 

I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger. 

I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. 

I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess. 

I wish enough "Hello's" to get you through the final "Good-bye..
