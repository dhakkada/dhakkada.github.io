Hello Washington students and families,

Welcome to a new school year. Some of you would have seen me in the corridor or classes, however, I would still like to introduce myself to you all through this write-up. My name is Ms. Dhara and I am a new school counselor. Yes that is right, you have two counselors this year at Washington. Yay! I would be at Washington every Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Friday mornings. I studied and lived in Portland for three years to become a counselor. Before that, I was in India. 
At Washington, my major role would be working with students in small groups, some classroom teaching, attendance monitoring, leadership program along with other daily behavioral or academic needs. I would also be involved in working with student families based on the need.      

I am very excited to start this school year at Washington and to be among you all.
