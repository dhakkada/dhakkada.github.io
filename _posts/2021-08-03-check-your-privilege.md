# Check your privilege!

In 1989, Peggy McIntosh a White American researcher developed a checklist based on her experiences of privilege as a White woman. This is a powerful exercise to understand your power and privilege as you move day-in and day-out in your life. Her statements focus on race-based privilege.

Motivated by her work, I prepared the below checklist to show other forms of privileges. In the current scenario where Critical Race Theory and especially the concept of Intersectionality as developed by Prof. Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw has taken a center stage, my understanding of privilege expanded to incorporate the intersectional nature of our being. It shows different forms of privilege we experience based on our different identities. The statements are just a few examples of how power and privilege are distributed based on who we are and where we are.

As I am currently working at a university in Germany, many of these statements are based on my current personal and professional experience.
The following statements reflect aspects of our daily life. They were adapted and created based on the work of Dr. Peggy McIntosh’s work on “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” (McIntosh, 1989).

Instructions for the activity: Please read each statement and indicate whether you agree or disagree with it. If you are unsure/unfamiliar, simply answer in a way that is most like you. There are no right or wrong responses.
