# Check your privilege!
In 1989, Dr. Peggy McIntosh, a White American researcher, developed a checklist based on her experiences of privilege as a White woman. Her work on White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack became a powerful exercise on how power and privilege work as one moves around in their daily life. Her statements focus on race-based privilege for White folks irrespective of their commitment to racial equality. On the other side, being a person of color (POC) or BIPOC or non-White in a predominantly White society leaves one with daily encounters rooted in discrimination and hardship.

Motivated by her work, I have prepared the below checklist to show other forms of privilege. The Critical Race Theory and especially the concept of Intersectionality as developed by Prof. Dr. Kimberl√© Crenshaw has increased my understanding of different forms of privilege beyond race. This checklist of privilege expands to incorporate the intersectional nature of unequal experiences and resulting discrimination. These are a few examples of how power and privilege are distributed based on our social identities and geographical location.

As I am currently working at a university in Germany, many of these statements are part of my personal and professional experience.
