## In Training

I had never thought to become a school counselor until I worked with some kids in an elementary school.
That was in 2007-08 and now in 2014 I have earned my Master’s degree in School Counseling. The path to
this day wasn’t very planned in detail but enough to reach this level. 

The real work begins now. 

Studying psychology and counseling is easy, you read through others’ work. Both my Masters degrees in
Psychology and Counseling, though gave me exposure to work with real humans. I could never believe fully
confident that I could work with real humans without harming them, especially the little ones. 

However, with studies, supervision and a passion for this work, I am about to begin my first official
job as a school counseling in two elementary schools. As much as I am excited and have some agendas
in my mind, I want to always remind myself about listening and empathy. This is my time to make the
difference and listen to the little human voices.
