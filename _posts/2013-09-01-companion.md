## Companion

Someone, somewhere is made for you.... 

I had known this when I was a teenager. It was such a romantic and beautiful
feeling while nervously and curiously trying to know who that someone was!
Time passes and we grow. Yet, to believe that someone is just for you really
matters. In my journey it was a quest which was fulfilled eventually. Today,
when I think about my someone I feel so special. Day by day I feel attached to
this individual. When I think of other couples I bet those are the same feelings.
Most of us do get to meet someone who makes us feel that they are made of us. 
Again the time passes and we grow. Sometimes these relationships changes, new
dynamics are encountered and we get a different frame of reference for the same
love and companionship. Sometimes the context changes with the same people and
sometimes person changes. In Indian culture, we still hold marriage as the final
destiny and consider him or her to remain together until death do us apart.
Indian societies have its own divorces but there is a lot more efforts to let
it work. Many couples have been together for years and years.... 

Re-marriage is a kind of an awkward situation for the person involved as well as
the family. (P.S. Our family members have a right to be part of such a private
decision of life.) Today, one of my cousin, is left alone. He lost his
wife 6 months back all of a sudden. I am wondering about the void in his life,
absence of his companion's smile, words, movement, tears, laughter and each of
those moments they made their own. At mid-life, is it possible for him to find
a new companion just like we do during teenage or young adulthood!! If yes,
will he (and ofcourse others) be able to accept that the new individual is new
and can't replace the old yet is fully welcomed. Isn't it all about companionship
and to be able to give and receive love!! 

A situation like this is common to hear. However, I wonder, each individual's
emotions attached during this circumstance. A grandfather is ready to select
his new companion but the granddaughter thinks he is giving away the place of
her grandmother to some random lady. A family is ready to get the son meet someone
new but son thinks that the family is in hurry to replace his wife... 

Emotions are so personal to us and we all want to process it with our own pace.
Interaction is awkward when two persons are at different levels of emotions about
the same construct. Let us accept someone's emotions. Let them be able to express
their emotions. As a society, we are not very private in fact we bring family
members together while making important decisions. Let us become more open to
talk about death and companionship after death. Let us not get carried away
by what is a norm but be able to process our emotions and make an appropriate
decision. There are many ways to make connections and to find companion even
in relationship that do not have a specific name.
