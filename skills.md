## [Foundations A]()

### Demonstrates the ability to apply and adhere to ethical and legal standards in school counseling

My Professional Disclosure Statement as a Counselor Intern was a step towards an ethical practice. 

[Professional Discolsure Statement](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/professionaldisclosurestatement.pdf)

I am a member of the American School Counseling Association (ASCA), Oregon School Counseling Association (OSCA) and Chi Sigma Iota - Portland State University chapter in order to stay connected with current ethical and professional practices. As a committed professional School Counselor I strive to fully adhere and abide by the Code of Ethics set by the American Counseling Association as well as the Ethical Standards set by the American School Counseling Association and the National Board for Certified Counselors.

[Ethical Standards 2010 ASCA](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/ethicalstandards2010asca.pdf)

[ACA Code of Ethics](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/aca-code-of-ethics.pdf)

[NBCC Code of Ethics](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/nbcccodeofethics.pdf)

For my Action Research project in the school, I adhered to ethical practice by submitting my proposal to Portland State University- Institutional Review Board. Following are the excerpt from the proposal that directly speak about ethical practice. 


## Informed Consent

*For this research study, the researcher would send with students the informed consent letter (appendix A) and field trip permission form (appendix B) at home for parents. Students whose parents would consent for participation would be further contacted. They would be provided with the assent form (appendix C) as they are older than 12 years.*


## Confidentiality, Records & distribution

*Each student will assign a number that they will use for pre- and post- survey. Completed student surveys will not be shared with other students or other school staff-members. Students identities will be concealed in tabulating and reporting the research data. Other than the survey, activities are conducted in a group setting. Researcher will inform the students and their parents in the consent and assent form as well as orally that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed in a group setting. All the surveys, assent forms and consent forms will be kept in a locked drawer in school counselor Elizabeth Williams office for three years. Digital records/notes would be stored in a password protected file for three years. No identifiable information would be stored in the digital records.*

## [Foundations B]()

### Demonstrates the ability to articulate, model, and advocate for an appropriate school counselor identity and program.

To set the Foundations of School Counseling, we created [Comprehensive Guidance Curriculum Project](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/comprehensive_guidance_counseling_program_-_middle_school.docx) (CGCP) for a middle school. This project was based on the American School Counseling Association (ASCA) [National Model](http://www.ascanationalmodel.org/) and [Oregon Comprehensive Guidance and Counseling Framework](http://www.ode.state.or.us/teachlearn/certificates/cam/pdfs/orframe/oregonframework-cgcp.pdf). We presented this project to Portland State faculty members, school administrators, school counselors and school counselors-in-training to create an appropriate school counselor identity and program.

---

It is essential to establish the identity of a school counselor with the first clients: students. In an effort to familiarize students with their school counselors and what do they do we visited classes at Cedar Park in the beginning of the year. These were 20 minutes interactive sessions each to introduce the work of School Counselors to the students Cedar Park that covers Academic, Career, and Personal-Social domain.

## [Counseling, Prevention and Intervention A]()

### Demonstrates [self-awareness](/assets/resources/pdx-graduate/selfawareness_activity.pdf), sensitivity to others, and the skills needed to relate to each diverse individual, group, and classroom.

Quarterly Evaluation from my internship site shows the comments from my supervisors at Cedar Park Middle School. In a summary, it shows that I demonstrated self-awareness, sensitivity and skills as a counselor with respect to my work with individual students, groups and after-school activities. 

Internship evaluation fall term:

_"Dhara has been proactive in engaging in school wide initiatives, helping to start and moderate a Latina Girls' Group. I have had the opportunity to observe her in a variety of situations with students. Dhara is an excellent listener and her interview skills are superb. We have also benefited from her analytical skills and insights in file reviews and classroom observations."_ - Andrew Witt (site-supervisor) 

Internship evaluation Winter term:

_"Dhara demonstrates great school counseling skills and instincts.  She has shown great ability to work with students and staff one-on-one and in groups.

## [Counseling, Prevention and Intervention B]()

### Provides individual and group counseling and classroom guidance to promote the academic, career, and personal and social development of students;

I demonstrated counseling, intervention and prevention skills at both Cedar Mill Elementary School and Cedar Park Middle School by delivering individual, group counseling sessions and classroom guidance. It was based on ASCA standards.

#### Sample Work:

##### Cedar Mill Elementary School:

## [Counseling, Prevention and Intervention C]()

### Designs and implements prevention and intervention plans related to the effects of: [Atypical growth and development](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/interventionforatypicalgrowthanddevelopment.rtf), [health and wellness](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/healthandwellness_1.docx), language, [ability level](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/report_on_individuals_with_exceptional_abilities.docx), [multicultural issues](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/lgbtqmulticultural_issues.pdf), and [factors of resiliency on student learning and development](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/6th-programoutline.docx).

[Blow it off using a jellyfish. For kids who needs some help breathing and dont want to use words.](assets/images/JellyBreath.jpg)

## [Counseling, Prevention and Intervention D]()

### Demonstrates the ability to use procedures for [assessing and managing suicide risk](#counseling-prevention-and-intervention-a); 

During my graduate school, I took [Applied Suicide Intervention and Skills Training](http://livingworks.net/page/Applied%20Suicide%20Intervention%20Skills%20Training%20(ASIST)) : [ASIST](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/AS1263-Pamphlet.pdf) training. It helped me to create a safety plan for one of my clients during the practicum, clinic experience. Client had come back for counseling as the anniversary of their previous suicide attempt was coming along with their child custody proceedings.
This training also helped me to work with a student in the school who had suicidal ideation. It helped me to work with my supervisor in maintaining the relevant notes after our meeting with the student.    
Finally, I am open about talks around suicide with my students. If I feel that the client might be wondering about killing self or harming, I have been upfront in checking with them. 
Following email conversation between school psychologist and I could give you an example of this:

dhara sheth <Dhara_Sheth@(district).k12.or.us> writes:
"Hi S,
I had a chance to check-in with (student):
He doesn't report of suicidal ideation or cutting. 
However, he reports that he is just hanging in there for his 8th grade.
He has not seen any doctor or counselor outside the school.
He agrees to meet with you and me for next week. 
Thank you so much,
Dhara"

## [Counseling, Prevention and Intervention E]()

### Demonstrates the ability to recognize his or her limitations as a school counselor and to seek supervision or refer clients when appropriate.

Professional Supervision:

Seeking supervision and continuous development was part of my internship experience. Each week, I met with my site-supervisors for an hour to discuss my work, various student issues and possible referrals. Hours of supervision at internship site: 19
I also met my university supervisor and colleagues at PSU for group supervision for 1hr/week for the entire academic year 2013-2014.

[Feedback](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/supervision.pdf) from site principal on classroom guidance lessons

Mental health referral:

At my middle school site, we have a student who showed symptoms of teen depression. As a school counselor, I am trained with mental health criteria from DSM IV. However, I do not officially diagnose it in school setting. Hence, I referred him to school psychologist and also communicated to the parents to consider consulting with a doctor or a mental health counselor. 

## [Diversity and Advocacy A]()

### Demonstrates multicultural competencies in relation to diversity, equity, and opportunity in student learning and development;


As a counselor at middle school, I conducted a research study with at-risk Latina students to provide career and post-secondary information. This study addressed the achievement gap and used the interventions with an aim of cultural sensitivity and equity mindedness. 

Topic: "To study the effects of career exploration interventions on Hispanic (Latina) students’ academic goals and post-secondary planning." 

Abstract

Providing career development services is an important task of middle school counselors. It is important that our students graduate from high school as college and career ready, in order to compete in the global world. This is particularly crucial with the underrepresented Hispanic/Latino students. We conducted a qualitative study on the impact of career exploration work with at-risk Latina students. Our study included meeting college Latina students at the university, participating in after-school workshops, and individual meetings with the counselor. The study provided students with knowledge of post-secondary options and observed if students were able to work through their own post-secondary plan. Some of their responses showed an increase in positive attitude towards school and the subjects. We also observed a noticeable impact in their aspirations to pursue higher education, which was reflected through their post-secondary plans. While we did not observe improvements in their current academic grades, we believe that it was due to extraneous factors which were outside the control of the study. Since other measurements point to an increased awareness of higher education and career options, we believe that our intervention was successful. Hence collaborative work between counselors and teachers is recommended to gain long-term academic outcomes.

## [Diversity and Advocacy B]()

### Advocates for the learning and academic experiences necessary to promote the academic, career, and personal/social development of students;


Due to scheduling logistics, some of the 8th grade students (20) who are in English Language Program or tier intervention, do not get technology as an elective. Technology class is the main medium for career guidance at this school

The counselors and I at the middle school, identified these students and invited them for a field-visit to [NW Youth Career Fair](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/2014_teacher_packet.pdf). 

Before the fair, we went into the classrooms and prepared these students about: how to introduce themselves, how to shake hands, how to ask questions, etc. as well as importance of formal clothing and professional attitude. 
At the fair, we divided the students into four groups with one counselor each. Students explored several booths based on their interest and curiosity. They inquired about higher studies needed for specific career/jobs. They introduced themselves and ask questions around expectations to be in armed forces. They did different activities such as CPR on manikin, climbing the ladder on Portland fire truck, getting hairstyles and make-ups, push-ups at Air force booth, tying show laces at Nike booth. Thus, they worked in a group and moved from booth to booth based on the interests of individuals within the groups.

## [Diversity and Advocacy C]()

### Advocates for school policies, programs, and services that enhance a positive school climate and are equitable and responsive to multicultural student populations; 

Some of the programs that I was part of or that I was instrumental in initiating with regards to this are:

1. [Bullying spirit day](assets/images/bullying_hurts.jpg): Students wrote two different messages on a sticky note. One talks about bullying experiences that hurts and other talks about incidences where somebody stood up for the victim to show care and courage. The school also introduced bullying report forms. 
2. [Student Support Group](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1UdUWo5toQuHKMjS3Jk53-ssfYcG9d4vtcNM7v4Dp7Ts/edit): A student came out to the school counselors and teachers and requested for a Gay-Straight Alliance at the middle school. We worked together and were instrumental in creating a student support group after-school club. This club was designed to address bullying, harassment, especially due to sexual identity and gender expression. This club invited all students who would like to participate for a positive school climate and talk about different identities. 
3. Developed [psycho-educational material](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/presidents_diversity_project.pdf) for creating awareness around issues of multicultural, racism and institutional oppression for underrepresented and minority communities at Portland State University. An [outreach effort](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1F3p6QTYO5AJbAvETxaMYyTB8F15p0rdzcnOKQ43jxEQ/edit) was also conducted to invite students for a counseling group.  
Advocated for a [CACREP program for counselors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt07NPvtZSo).

## [Assessment A]()

### Assesses and interprets students’ strengths and needs, recognizing uniqueness in cultures, languages, values, backgrounds, and abilities

During the internship, there were several occasions where I had used assessments based on uniqueness of the students. Some of these assessments were based on observations, [interactions with the students and their teachers](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1itC-ZbqoMPnibd7gmP6D2zfBCEUTjRBuUtDU0TgDisE/edit). 

Once a teacher had asked if I could work with a students struggling in her class. She also hinted that the relationship between that teacher and student was negative and the student had mentioned couple of times how she hates the teacher. 

This was one of our high risked student who was dropped out in grade 7th and had ran away from school and home. As a counselor, I tried assessing the sensitivity of the situation and decided to build a positive relationship with the student. 
We focused on her strengths drawing from her future dreams, her interests, her past achievements. 
Classroom observations to understand the friction and continues checking with teacher and the student on weekly basis. 
Through regular check-ins, learned the hunger issues and provided free snacks at times. 


Quantitative assessments: 

During the school year, several programs and interventions were planned for students. For most of these programs, I had pre-intervention assessments to understand where does a student stands. Then, after the intervention, post-intervention assessments were used to analysed the effectiveness of the program for future work. 

One such program was Summit Social Group for 6th grade students that involved working with students on team-building, trust, learning zones, challenges, hike, Ropes Course. 
[Summit Assessment](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1RZ58ZiPcsdP8-h8nmZuovGSzq5NLDjrb_2jynOdAtyI/edit)

## [Assessment B]()

### Selects appropriate assessment strategies that can be used to evaluate a student’s academic, career, and personal/social development;

One of the sample to show the work with a student in all the areas of career, academic, personal/social work would be a SST (Student Support Team) referral report. We had a student who was struggling in her academics, particularly math where she had never met the standards since elementary school. Teachers were concerned for her work and learning. Parents were informed during the conferences and then we decided her to refer for special education  testing. while working for this student, I reviewed/did 
* Cumulative file
* OAKs scores
* Attendance 
* Report Cards
* Work samples 
* Classroom observations
* SWIS trackers, referrals
* Easy CBM scores
* Family situation
* One-on-one interaction with students and the teacher
* Phone call to parents
After evaluating the students development in different areas a report was prepared to present to the school SST team to further discuss how to best support the student. 

Another assessments used were [CICO](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/cico.pdf) and [hug](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/eli_hug.doc) sheet for students struggling in the classroom. This was a positive behavior intervention strategy to motivate the student to complete their work in class. 

## [Assessment C]()

### Analyzes assessment information in a manner that produces valid inferences when evaluating the needs of individual students and assessing the effectiveness of educational programs

A student was referred through SST (Student Support Team) for possibility of Special Education Referral in the academic areas. Based on several assessments, the following report was generated to prove a case to further support the student. 

* [SST Report](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/sst_report.docx)

During the school year, Action Research was conducted that was based on initial needs assessments, school report card data, school improvement plan as well as Oregon data. The [research findings](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1pkVnrMSgpnp2maiTX84qE2N5ZJiS5J1x1-MvkROojwg/edit) were shared and discussed with further implications. 

## [Assessment D]()

### Makes appropriate referrals to school and/or community resources

Based on the [SST referral](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/sst_report.docx), we made a referral to the Special Education team for evaluating for attention and math learning difficulty.  


_Mental Health Referral_

In another instance, one of the 8th grade student requested to meet us. After working with him for a couple of times, I suspected some signs of depression. The student also reported thinking of cutting. On a immediate note, the parents were informed and we had a conference with parents and the grandmother. Parents were suggested to consider outside counseling or see a doctor. After some time, the father agreed to take him to NAMI. 
Along with that, I also contacted the school psychologist to check-in with the student. We worked together with the student. However, student refused to see anyone outside the school. So, we had decided to do weekly check-ins with the student to assess the depressed mood and cutting ideation. 
A heads-up to the student's  high school counselor was also considered anticipating the incoming transition.


Sample email conversation with school psychologist:
"I had a chance to check-in with (student).  
He doesnt report of suicidal ideation or cutting right now.  
However, he reports that he is just hanging in there for his 8th grade.  
He has not seen any doctor or counselor outside the school.  
He agrees to meet with you and me for next week.   
Could we meet other than Wednesday? He is in choir and they have some event that day outside school. How is your Thursday?  
It would be very helpful to have your clinical say in this situation.   
Thank you so much,  
Dhara"  

Referral to the Truancy Officer:

Two of the students were reported to the truancy officer for their chronic absence to the school and dropping out during the academic year. 


## [Assessment E]()

### [Assesses barriers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pfaS5btRYLjOdhKfcIdkwlsb7dvkopRaD6ftKgI2tmo/viewform?usp=send_form) that impede students’ academic, career, and personal and social development.

A survey was created for current 6th grade students to assess their perception of transition and especially the new middle school. This survey could help to generalize and anticipate the needs and barriers for incoming 6th graders. 

Other assessments:

## [Research and Evaluation C]()

### Analyzes and uses data to enhance school counseling programs.

1. As a counselor, I understand the importance of school wide [SWIS data](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/swis_report_4_7_14.pdf) as a reference to inform the school counseling program and activities.
2. To inform the school counseling program, [data from the State and the school](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1MlMp9fIqIA9RadWnSrIjv0411XuGoxsAczVP-z4gz5g/edit) were used regarding college and career readiness intervention.

## [Academic Development A]()

## [Academic Development C]()

### Implements [differentiated instructional strategies](assets/images/nwyouthcareerfair.jpg) that draw on subject matter and pedagogical content knowledge and skills to promote student achievement.

## [Collaboration and Consultation A]()

### Works with parents, guardians, and families to act on behalf of their children to [address problems that affect student success in school](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/504plan.pdf);


As a school counselor, it is my belief that student success improves when school and parents collaborate. Here is a summary of a collaboration with parents and teachers to help students at school. 

A student (grade 3) went home upset and hurt from the school due to issues around friendship. She told her parents that she doesn't like to go to school. Parent promptly email the class teacher and the school Principal expressing their concern. Principal asked me to work in this situation and help the students. I called the students involved in this situation individually and all together. I facilitated a frank discussion about each others' feelings about friendship and feelings towards each other. We also discussed individual boundaries and willingness to open them for others. At last the girls went home. 

Parents emailed us later saying that their daughter had her "Most awesome day" and she is happy to find someone comforting who understands her. She is very much willing to come to school and consider her friendship boundaries with other students. 

Parents were grateful for my work according to the email.  

## [Collaboration and Consultation B]()

### Locates resources in the community that can be used in the school to improve student achievement and success;

Wrap-around services for students that ultimately impacts their learning ability

Many students come to school hungry or with insufficient snacks and food. While these students stay long hours at school without sufficient food for the growing body, it hampers their concentration, attention and mood. All of these have impact on their academics. 
School counselors connected with a local church to bring in snacks for the students. These snacks were kept in the counseling room, office, with school psychologist, etc. Teachers were also informed about this resources. Slowly and gradually we saw many students would come-in to grab a snack or two. It was a snack pantry in the school with the help of local church.

Beaverton has [Welcome center](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/Welcome Center Info English.pdf) for students and family who are in need of services and resources outside school. We collaborated with them with the help of community liaison to provide resources to the students.

[Holiday meals and support](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/support.pdf) was provided by coordinating between the church and the families through phone calls. 

## [Collaboration and Consultation C]()

### [Consults with teachers, staff](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/feedback_from_teachers.pdf), and community-based organizations to promote student academic, career, and personal/social development;

Ongoing consultation with teachers about individual students' performance and development. [Sample email](https://docs.google.com/a/pdx.edu/document/d/1HSsKY2iEOnUTsTj29dz9lWbTC7w1Mz27miuhnhTyOSM/edit).

Besides this, attended 
* Staff meetings
* Team meetings
* RTI meetings
* SST meetings

## [Collaboration and Consultation D]()

### Uses peer helping strategies in the school counseling program; and


At the middle school, we have [WEB](http://www.boomerangproject.com/middle-school-transition) (Where Everybody Belongs) program that utilizes 8th grade model students to help younger students. During the first day at school, only 6th grade students and WEB leaders come to the school to ease the transition. I was able to see the WEB leaders helping younger students. 

To create a positive school environment and help students to learn from each other's experiences around Bullying, we created a wall of messages. One of our Spirit day was an "Orange Day". Teachers were provided with advisory lesson plans and students wrote their messages. Our [anti-bullying](assets/images/bullying_hurts.jpg) team collected those messages and paste them to create a school-wide message. 

Social Skills group was organized to foster peer relationships and helping. One of the lesson was on [building trust with peers and helping each other](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/class_5_trust.docx). 

## [Collaboration and Consultation E]()

### Uses referral procedures with helping agents in the community such as: mental health centers, businesses, and service groups; to [secure assistance for students and their families](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/https___doc-14-9g-apps-viewer.googleusercontent.pdf).

Phone calls and face-to-face conversations were made to refer students and families to outside agencies such as mental health professionals, eye care, clothing business, churches, food pantries. 


## [Leadership A]()

### Participates in the design, implementation, management, and evaluation of a [comprehensive developmental school counseling program](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/comprehensive_guidance_counseling_program_-_middle_school.docx); 

For the foundations of school counseling, we created a comprehensive guidance counseling program for middle school addressing the impact of drug and alcohol use on the students' academic performance.

## [Leadership B]()

### Plans and presents school-counseling-related educational programs for use with parents and teachers such as: [parent education](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/parent_education.docx) programs, materials used in classroom guidance, and [advisor and advisee](assets/resources/pdx-graduate/advisorylessonoct15and16.docx) programs for teachers.

Different classroom activities on college and career readiness was conducted with 4th and 5th grade students. One example was career lesson using [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/k12/content/students/careers/career-exploration.htm) (BLS) site for students. Students browsed through this site and we encouraged the students to show it to their parents/guardians to discuss further.
